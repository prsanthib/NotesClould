## Overview

The `web-vitals` library is a tiny (~1K), modular library for measuring all the [Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/) metrics on real users, in a way that accurately matches how they're measured by Chrome and reported to other Google tools (e.g. [Chrome User Experience Report](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-user-experience-report), [Page Speed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/), [Search Console's Speed Report](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/11/search-console-speed-report.html)).

The library supports all of the [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/#core-web-vitals) as well as all of the [other Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/#other-web-vitals) that can be measured [in the field](https://web.dev/user-centric-performance-metrics/#how-metrics-are-measured):

### Core Web Vitals

- [Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)](https://web.dev/cls/)
- [First Input Delay (FID)](https://web.dev/fid/)
- [Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](https://web.dev/lcp/)

### Other Web Vitals

- [First Contentful Paint (FCP)](https://web.dev/fcp/)
- [Time to First Byte (TTFB)](https://web.dev/ttfb/)
